# Introduction
The difficulty on finding instructional material that covers the complexities of 
writing scientific code, and deploying it in High-Performance Computing (HPC) 
environments led to the writing of this guide.

This is a non-exhaustive work, but rather a reference one, in which the author 
wishes to reduce the barriers of routine HPC workflows for Remote Sensing run at 
the [McMaster University Remote Sensing Laboratory](https://remotesensing-mcmaster.org).

These guidelines are provided without any guarantee, including of support, but 
in a best effort to overcome the aforementioned barriers.

I encourage users to suggest corrections, by clicking in the edit button 
(available on the online version of this guide), and submitting a pull request.
