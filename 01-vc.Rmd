# Version Control Systems
*Version Control Systems* @wiki_version_control (VCS - also named as _Revision Control_, 
_Source Code Control_, _Source Code Management_) are Computer Systems 
traditionally used to manage the complexities of software development, majorly 
Computer Systems involving multiple software modules, and large development teams.

Such systems help to organize such development, especially when collaboration of
multiple developers is done, and several times people are doing code changes in a same, or close, 
part of the code, which may break it, or even generate unexpected results that would not be traceable.

<!-- ## Why using it (out of CS)? -->
<!-- Science is becoming more collaborative everyday, with groups of people contributing within a  -->
<!-- same research group, across groups and across institutions. At the same time, efforts on Open Science, and Reproducible Science are demanded by the scientific community as a way to measure progress in transparent and objective criteria, as well as providing accountability on such developments. Since  -->
<!-- the interactions between academics and industries are becoming more frequent, scientists are also called -->
<!-- to bring a same accountability level as if they were stakeholders of such companies. -->

<!-- Given this scenario, CVS systems are often used in a way to provide towards the scientific method (when using computational resources): -->

<!-- - Open Science -->
<!-- -- Open data:  -->
<!-- -- Open source-code: -->
<!-- -- Open access: -->
<!-- -- Open peer-review: -->
<!-- -- Open educational resources: -->
<!-- - FAIR data -->
<!-- -- Data is Findable: -->
<!-- -- Data is accessible: -->
<!-- -- Data (and code) are interoperable: -->
<!-- -- Data (and experiments) are reusable: -->
<!-- - Reproducible experiments:  -->

## VCS: Local repository vs. Remote repository
Common VCS's (ex.: [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), 
[SVN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) and
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)) always are client-server systems.

The VCS client is not merely a means to access a central repository hosted 
at the VCS server, but actually is part of running checks and balances that are 
necessary when adding code to the central repository. A situation that demands that
is when multiple users are doing a change in a same piece of code, and checking 
it only at the central repository may complicate more a situation already 
complicated (simultaneous contribution). Therefore, it hosts, locally 
a local copy of the codebase, which reflects a view of that codebase in time 
(more preciselly when that local user retrieved a copy from the central repository 
for editing).

Once the changes are done, the user saves a local copy of these at the local repository, 
and if these meet the criteria for changes (and this may vary a lot among systems), 
the user is able to persist this change at the local repository, as a new version of 
the codebase. This process is known as _commit_ (in this case, a local one).


## Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a contemporary VCS that is used as the backbone 
of operations run on GitHub. So, when planning to operate with GitHub, it is 
almost certain that you will need to install a Git client on your machine. 

We can say _almost_ because GitHub provides an own client, 
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) which provides a Graphical User 
Interface(GUI) to a git client. 

We will not cover such GUI usage since on Compute Canada you will not have access 
to GitHub Desktop on their machines, but only to 
a regular Git client (that you can use to access either GitHub, or another Git 
compliant server such as a private repository built with 
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)).

### Installing a git client on your machine

#### Ubuntu (or any other Debian-based environment)
First update your Operating System (OS) repository indexes:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Then proceed to install:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Note: If you use Ubuntu, git is already provided as a base repository on this 
distribution. If you use another linux, and this does not work for you, please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/ricardobarroslourenco/CCprimer/issues) on 
this project and use the label _requests_, and I will try to solve and include 
here for future reference.

#### Apple
Apple is an OS that not use repositories by default, and git is not provided in 
the main set of software. So you would have three main options to install git:

- Install Xcode (*Preferred*): Apple has a software development kit (SDK) named 
[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) which provides git among several other
software for MacOS and iOS software development. The advantage of using XCode´s 
git distribution is that it comes adjusted for your OS and is supported by Apple,
whcih avoids conflicts and security issues.
  - To install XCode (and git by consequence), open the App Store, and search 
  XCode as a software developed by Apple, and install it. To test, open the 
  Terminal App, and run _git_. You should receive an output of basic 
description of commands available on git.
- Install Homebrew, and then install Git (if you are a Homebrew user, or uses a 
lot of *.nix software not supported by Apple it is useful): 
  - [Download and install homebrew](https://brew.sh/) from their website;
  - Install git as:
  ```{bash, eval=FALSE}
  $ brew install git
  ```
  - In the terminal, run _git_ and you should receive an output of basic 
description of commands available on git.
- Install a standalone version of git (*not recommended*): You can download and 
install from git´s website a standalone client (I will not be covering this 
approach, because git will not be updated via this kind a install, posing a 
security risk and install this at your own risk - and effort!)

#### Windows
Since Windows works with standalone installations, the install follows as this:

- Go to the Git website and [download](https://git-scm.com/download/win) the 
latest client (download the standalone version, unless you have severe storage 
limitations on your machine);
- Once downloaded, run the installer with admin permissions and follow the 
default installation;
- When installed, open PowerShell (PS) (or the command prompt, if you do not 
have PS installed), and run _git_ and hit enter. You should receive an output of basic 
description of commands available on git.

### Setting up your local git client
Once you have your git client up and running, you need to setup the access 
credentials to connect to a git repository, such as GitHub or GitLab for example.

To do so, run on your bash terminal (or command-line if on windows):
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git config -- global user.name "Your full name"
```
Note: On quotes you need to specify a name (depending on the environment, 
it should be your full name, or an alias, such as employee number, for example). This 
command has a global scope, so all users on your machine would have the same setup.

Then you need to specify an e-mail address (if on GitHub, it is preferred that 
is linked to your account):
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git config -- global user.email "Your e-mail address"
```

Then check, if all values were set:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git config --list
```
You should see an output that reflects those previously set name and e-mail values.

## GitHub
<!-- GitHub is a web.... --- Describe -->
GitHub is a Web collaborative Version Control service based on a Git platform. It was
created in 2008, and as of today is the largest repository of source code in the World.
Aside of VCS capabilities, it provides other computational services, such as 
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), Web Page Hosting on GitHub 
Pages, security solutions, a software marketplace, among many others. It was recently 
acquired by Microsoft, as one of the largest transactions in the tech domain.

GitHub has several different [tiers of access](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-products#about-githubs-products), from basic free accounts up to corporate ones.

A main advantage for academic users would be using the [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) which includes a free [GitHub PRO](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-products#github-pro) 
account and several software for free (or services credit hours) while you are 
enrolled in an academic institution. GitHub Education also have [different tiers of users](https://education.github.com/benefits) aiming students, teachers, and 
the academic institutions itselves. Once you create a simple free GitHub account, 
you can return back to GitHub Education, and request to be enrolled in the program.

### Creating an account
To create an account is simple:
- Go to [GitHub pricing page](https://github.com/pricing), select the Free tier, 
and click _Join for Free_;
- Just follow the prompts to create your personal account.
- You should receive an e-mail from them on the registered e-mail account, to verify your identity. If you fail to do so, your account would be basically [useless](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address#about-email-verification). 
 
Note: Since I have created my account some years ago, I am just using GitHub's
user documentation as reference. If things get complicated in this step, please let me know, and I will expand here.
