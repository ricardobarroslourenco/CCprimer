# Version Control Systems
*Version Control Systems* @wiki_version_control (VCS - also named as _Revision Control_, 
_Source Code Control_, _Source Code Management_) are Computer Systems 
traditionally used to manage the complexities of software development, majorly 
Computer Systems involving multiple software modules, and large development teams.

Such systems help to organize such development, especially when collaboration of
multiple developers is done, and several times people are doing code changes in a same, or close, 
part of the code, which may break it, or even generate unexpected results that would not be traceable.

## Why using it (out of CS)?
Science is becoming more collaborative everyday, with groups of people contributing within a 
same research group, across groups and across institutions. At the same time, efforts on Open Science, and Reproducible Science are demanded by the scientific community as a way to measure progress in transparent and objective criteria, as well as providing accountability on such developments. Since 
the interactions between academics and industries are becoming more frequent, scientists are also called
to bring a same accountability level as if they were stakeholders of such companies.

Given this scenario, CVS systems are often used in a way to provide towards the scientific method (when using computational resources):

- Open Science
-- Open data: 
-- Open source-code:
-- Open access:
-- Open peer-review:
-- Open educational resources:
- FAIR data
-- Data is Findable:
-- Data is accessible:
-- Data (and code) are interoperable:
-- Data (and experiments) are reusable:
- Reproducible experiments:
