### Running batch jobs
If you want to run a R-language batch job, please take a look on the 
[CCrecipes repository](https://github.com/ricardobarroslourenco/CCrecipes). 

More specifically at the `slurm/R/r_batch_standalone.sh` file, we have:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash

### Sets shell for parallel program (no distribution - no MPI)
### Inspired by the current documentation available on CC Wiki.

#SBATCH --account=def-someacct             # replace this with your PI account
#SBATCH --nodes=1                          # number of node MUST be 1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4                  # number of processes
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2048M                # memory; default unit is megabytes
#SBATCH --time=0-00:15                     # time (DD-HH:MM)
#SBATCH --mail-user=yourname@someplace.com # Send email updates to you or someone else
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL                    # send an email in all cases (job started, job ended, job aborted)

### Load library modules
module load gcc/9.3.0 r/4.0.2

### Load r-packages (builds locally) - comment, if unecessary to install new libraries
#R install_script.R

### Export locally installed packages
# TODO: check if this path holds
export R_LIBS=~/local/R_libs/

### Run main_job.R - or any batch script necessary
R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore ~/main_job.R
```

Some requirements:

- The R file `main_job.R` needs to be at the root of your user folder. 
- Also the script needs to be executable (command runned at the same folder 
as `r_batch_standalone.sh`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ chmod +x r_batch_standalone.sh
```

- Finally, you can submit this batch job as:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ sbatch r_batch_standalone.sh
```

Once submitted, you should receive a job number at the console. Once its status
change at the scheduler (job started, job ended, job aborted), you should receive
an e-mail. 

If getting into running issues, take a look on the errors by inspecting the 
output files which will be saved at the same folder you submitted the job and 
have the name `slurm-xxxxxx.out` in which `xxxxxx` is the job number.
