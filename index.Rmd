<!-- ## Dedication -->

## Epigraph
> "Here's to the crazy ones.
> The misfits.
> The rebels.
> The troublemakers.
> The round pegs in the square holes.
>
> The ones who see things differently.
>
> They're not fond of rules.
> And they have no respect for the status quo.
>
> You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
> About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
>
> Because they change things.
>
> They push the human race forward.
>
> While some may see them as the crazy ones,
we see genius.
>
> Because the people who are crazy enough to think
they can change the world, are the ones who do."

<!-- ## Usage  -->

<!-- Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. -->

<!-- Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`. -->

<!-- The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. -->

<!-- ## Render book -->

<!-- You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: -->

<!-- 1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and -->

<!-- 1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. -->

<!-- Or build the book from the R console: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- bookdown::render_book() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>. -->

<!-- ## Preview book -->

<!-- As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console: -->
